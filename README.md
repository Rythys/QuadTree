A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. 
Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. 

The data associated with a leaf cell varies by application, but the leaf cell represents a "unit of interesting spatial information". 
In my realization quadtree store a vector of points x and y. 
This work was a problem what i have to do on programming course at MSU.
Quadtree is also a have perfect aplication for optimizing taxi ordering.

A quadtree of depth d for n points contains O(d⋅n) nodes and can be constructed in O(d⋅n) time.
